Skillsets that I have: I am very patient person, and responsible which I think is very important to work in a group. I have basic skills in Python, Java, and JS.
My strength in Computer Programming is working with Python, writing codes there. I know this language better than others because I took several classes for it. My weaknesses is that it is hard for me to start something from a blank. Usually i do not know where to start and what to do. I am working on it. I understand that I need to make a plan first and then it would be easier.
I have a basic HTML and CSS skills, I took some classes. I believe that I have enough skills. I know how to create an HTML page and I can create CSS for it.
I have not created a web application yet.
I did in my Java class.
I am comfortable with Python, as I mentioned earlier Python is the language I am most comfortable working with. Working with OOP is okay foe me.
I am using Teams since my first semester at Wake Tech, so I am very familiar and comfortable with it.
I used Git and GitHub several times. I know how to use it and what is it for, but I can not say that I am very familiar with it. There is still things to explore.
